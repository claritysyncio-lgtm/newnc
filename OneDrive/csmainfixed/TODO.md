# TODO: Fix Dynamic Route Typing in Next.js

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Edit src/app/templates/[id]/page.tsx to remove async and await from params
- [x] Verify no Promise or async typing remains
- [x] Commit changes with message "Fix dynamic route typing"
- [x] Push to GitHub for Vercel redeploy

## Notes
- PageProps interface is already correctly defined
- Function needs to be synchronous as params is an object, not a Promise
- Build succeeded after fixing typing in both dynamic routes
